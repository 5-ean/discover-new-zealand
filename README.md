# UX

### **STRATEGY, SCOPE & STRUCTURE**
**Business Objective:**
>The **business objective** is to increase interest in visiting New Zealand through the [*Discover New Zealand*](https://5-ean.github.io/discover-new-zealand/) webiste. The objective is focused on B2C (business to customer) sales, so it will be a more emotive driven experience. Using bold visuals and accessible language will ensure the project reaches the largest possible user base.

**Target User:** 
> * Users curious about New Zealand
> * Users of all age ranges (appropirate content)
> * English speakers & Users with English as second language (minimal wording/complexity to aid accessibility for all)
> * Users from all over the globe with varying internet connection speeds (website optimised to reduce loading times where possible)
> * Users of all platforms (mobile first design)

**User Stories:**
> 1. "As a user who has never been to New Zealand, is the site going to provide relevant information? Will it be easy to understand? Can I see topics that interest me quickly…..or will I have to read pages of information to find out? I don’t want to spend a long time on the site, but I want my experience to be rewarding."
>
> 2. "As a mobile dependent user of this website, I want to have a polished and engaging experience on the website even though I do not have access to a desktop/laptop."
>
> 3. "As a visual user of the website, I want high quality media displayed on the site for my viewing pleasure. I find images & videos more appealing than lots of text."
>
> 4. "As an interested user of the website, I want to send questions if I require more information….is their reciprocation? Can you send me additional information at my request? This will provide me with the extra details to make an informed decision about visiting New Zealand."
>
> 5. "As a less technical user I want an easy to navigate website, over-complicated designs will put me off exploring the site. Which will keep me for recommending and returning to the website in the future."  

**Addressing User Stories & Business Objective**  
> * Home page: basic requirement for all sites, will “sell” experience to user and provide eye catching hero image (addressing business objective).
> * About page: addressing user story 1.
> * Gallery page: addressing user story 3.
> * Get In Touch page: addressing user stories 4.
> * Use of Bootstrap: addressing user stories 2 & 5.

**Project Content** 
>Within [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) a [table](https://github.com/5-ean/discover-new-zealand/blob/563bcd72d188b530b0f83b66682e1105c0e8078d/assets/ux_assets/images/content-table.pdf) of possible content was created to populate the project. A **wireframe site map** was then created to structure the content and project as a whole.
>
> The [Wireframe](https://github.com/5-ean/discover-new-zealand/blob/7f9d3df776b7bd97d4fdb0b2986230bd2601a7bd/assets/ux_assets/images/sitemap-wireframe.pdf) site map is a rough guide. Some content has been removed, specifically *(content)FAQ's*, *(content)videos* and *(content)links through to booking* because it lacks importance or is not viable at this time. 
 
### **SKELETON & SURFACE**

>The remaining features and content kept in make up the **minimal viable product** at this time. The **MVP** *(minimal viable product)* consists of the [Home](https://github.com/5-ean/discover-new-zealand/blob/7f9d3df776b7bd97d4fdb0b2986230bd2601a7bd/assets/ux_assets/images/index.html-wireframe.pdf) page, [About](https://github.com/5-ean/discover-new-zealand/blob/7f9d3df776b7bd97d4fdb0b2986230bd2601a7bd/assets/ux_assets/images/about.html-wireframe.pdf), [Gallery](https://github.com/5-ean/discover-new-zealand/blob/7f9d3df776b7bd97d4fdb0b2986230bd2601a7bd/assets/ux_assets/images/gallery.html-wireframe.pdf) & [Get In Touch](https://github.com/5-ean/discover-new-zealand/blob/7f9d3df776b7bd97d4fdb0b2986230bd2601a7bd/assets/ux_assets/images/get-in-touch.html-wireframe.pdf) pages respectively.

**Colour Scheme & Background**
> The pictures used for the project were of natural landscapes with high ratios of green, blue, white, and brown colouring. Therefore, the stylistic choice was to use off white/grey colouring with opacity for the footer element. The Header was a solid grey colour to block content scrolling under as the user move the page up. The colour scheme along with subtle, thin borders around content elements gave a natural feel to the site overall.
>
>   *Navigation background colour*
> * Hex  (#cfcccc)
>
>  *Footer background colours:*
> * rgba(185, 185, 185, 0.5)
>  
>  *Content background colour:*
> * rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5 - 0.7)

**Buttons & Links**

>To aid usability links and buttons followed the same style. Notably changing from black to white when hovered over. This is a sharp contrast and a nod to New Zealand Sports and Culture as white and black have long been the colour scheme for the country in many regards.

**Displey and Browser Testing**
> * **Moblie View:** On small screen sizes(mobile) the content for each page is centralise. The header nav links collapses into a right-handed dropdown menu when interacted with. The footer only displays the social links and contact us modal link.
>
> * The about page which was three columns on large screen sizes now switches to display the content vertically. 
>
> * On the gallery page in small size sizes the captions underneath the bootstrap carousel images are hidden, along with in caption information accompanying the videos.

**Validating User Stories**
> **Story 1 - ("Will it be easy to understand? Can I see topics that interest me quickly....") :** 
>The bulk of the site information is found on one html page (about), It is a summary of three general topic that should interest most users. If they require more information the button “Learn More” will open a new tab to the Wikipedia article the specific topic is referencing.

>**Story 2 - (As a mobile dependent user of this website, I want to have a polished and engaging experience...") :**
>The website has been tested on all mobile screen sizes within html inspector. It is responsive due to the use of bootstrap. All site functions/links were tested on a OnePlus 3T mobile device and worked as expected.

> **Story 3 - ("As a visual user of the website, I want high quality media displayed on the site for my viewing pleasure...") :**
>The gallery page contains high quality images and videos of New Zealand with accompanying information on larger device sizes, on small mobile devices the page just contains images and video and minimal text. 

>**Story 4 - ("...I want to send questions if I require more information….is their reciprocation? Can you send me additional information at my request?") :**
>Users can complete a form found in the footer (contact us link) or in the ‘get in touch page’. It contains space to send a question, along with other basic information fields. The form needs to be completed in full in order for the Form Submitted message to appear. 

>**Story 5 - ("As a less technical user I want an easy to navigate website, over-complicated designs will put me off...") :**
> The site follows clear and logical progression, with links and interactive elements all sharing similar stylings. The content is laid out with a western target audience in mind (reading left to right) and this is reflected in the information layout of the nav header, footer and main pages of the website. With Most important on the left to least important on the right. All feature and link are accessible within three mouse clicks of entering the site.
### Links :
> * All social links tested and open in seperate windows.
> * All internal navigation links tested and lead to described locations within same browser window.
> * All pindrop google map links (gallery.html- carousel caption area) tested, open in new window and correspond to image displayed on website.

### Form :

**Bugs & Fixes**

>General - 
> * Text sizing issue within nav and footer sections. Had to use media queries based on veiwport width to adjust at different breakpoints. This resized the text so it wasn't so large on smaller devices.
> * I could not give my hero-image class (Website background) an alt attribute. Still not resolved, this will have to be a future fix. It affects accessibility on all pages.
> * Container-fluid class margin L + R auto causes issues in md, lg and larger screen sizes. The width is not being used effectively. Not fixed at this time, but site is still viewable on all devices.

>About Page: Learn More Button - 
> * Originally an < a > link nested inside a button element, this is invalid by w3c standards. Link leads to relevant wikipedia source page. Fixed using solution from stack overflow. Onclick="window.open(...) allowed me to remove < a > element and keep button element inplace.

>Get In Touch Page: Form - 
> * On page opening invalid feedback is present, ideally the form would be neutral until interacted with by the user. No Fixed at this time, due to complexity and lack of understanding on my part, will be revisited.
