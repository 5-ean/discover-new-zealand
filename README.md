## UX

### **STRATEGY**, **SCOPE & STRUCTURE**

**Business Objective:**
>The **business objective** is to increase interest in visiting New Zealand through the *Discover New Zealand* webiste. The objective is focused on B2C (business to customer) sales, so it will be a more emotive driven experience. Using bold visuals and accessible language will ensure the project reaches the largest possible user base.

**Target User:** 
> * Users curious about New Zealand
> * Users of all age ranges (appropirate content)
> * English speakers & Users with English as second language (minimal wording/complexity to aid accessibility for all)
> * Users from all over the globe with varying internet connection speeds (website optimised to reduce loading times where possible)
> * Users of all platforms (mobile first design)

**User Stories:**
> 1. "As a user who has never been to New Zealand, is the site going to provide relevant information? Will it be easy to understand? Can I see topics that interest me quickly…..or will I have to read pages of information to find out? I don’t want to spend a long time on the site, but I want my experience to be rewarding."
>
> 2. "As a mobile dependent user of this website, I want to have a polished and engaging experience on the website even though I do not have access to a desktop/laptop."
>
> 3. "As a visual user of the website, I want high quality media displayed on the site for my viewing pleasure. I find images & videos more appealing than lots of text."
>
> 4. "As an interested user of the website, I want to send questions if I require more information….is their reciprocation? Can you send me additional information at my request? This will provide me with the extra details to make an informed decision about visiting New Zealand."
>
> 5. "As a less technical user I want an easy to navigate website, over-complicated designs will put me off exploring the site. Which will keep me for recommending and returning to the website in the future."  

>**Addressing User Stories & Business Objective**  
> * Home page: basic requirement for all sites, will “sell” experience to user and provide eye catching hero image (addressing business objective).
> * About page: addressing user story 1.
> * Gallery page: addressing user story 3.
> * Get In Touch page: addressing user stories 4.
> * Use of Bootstrap: addressing user stories 2 & 5.

**Project Content** 
>Within [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) a [table](/workspace/discover-new-zealand/assets/ux_assets/images/content-table.pdf) of possible content was created to populate the project. A **wireframe site map** was then created to structure the content and project as a whole.
>
> The [Wireframe](/workspace/discover-new-zealand/assets/ux_assets/images/sitemap-wireframe.pdf) site map is a rough guide. Some content has been removed, specifically *(content)FAQ's*, *(content)videos* and *(content)links through to booking* because it lacks importance or is not viable at this time. 
 
### **SKELETON & SURFACE**

>The remaining features and content kept in make up the **minimal viable product** at this time. The **MVP** *(minimal viable product)* consists of the [Home](/workspace/discover-new-zealand/assets/ux_assets/images/index.html-wireframe.pdf) page, [About](/workspace/discover-new-zealand/assets/ux_assets/images/about.html-wireframe.pdf), [Gallery](/workspace/discover-new-zealand/assets/ux_assets/images/gallery.html-wireframe.pdf) & [Get In Touch](/workspace/discover-new-zealand/assets/ux_assets/images/get-in-touch.html-wireframe.pdf) pages respectively.
